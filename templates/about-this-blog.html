 <h2>About this blog</h2>
   <hr>
   <p>
   	This blog uses a static site generator written in Flask/Python to transform markdown files directly into html. There is no need to alter the already written html code, you just upload the text files in .md format, run it through the generator and voila - a new static page.  You don't even need a working Internet connection to write stuff if you think about it, just upload it when you feel like it. Also, it's fast and you can host it at an affordable price as a static web site. This site is hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket taking advantage of their one year free user tier ;). Basically, this is a dead easy yet powerful static website generator! 
   </p>
   <p>For all of you web devs out there these are the main blog ingredients:
 <ul>
  <li><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a></li>
  <li><a href="hhttp://pythonhosted.org/Flask-FlatPages/">Flask-FlatPages</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/">Frozen-Flask</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions.<br>
Flask-FlatPages provides a collections of pages to your Flask application. Pages are built from “flat” text files as opposed to a relational database.</p>
<p>
Frozen-Flask freezes a Flask application into a set of static files. The result can be hosted without any server-side software other than a traditional web server.
